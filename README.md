As there don't seem to be a lot of Colemak-DH layouts out there for the [Svalboard](https://svalboard.com), apart from the sample layout, I'll share mine in the meantime.

Just keep in mind that I at first adapted a big part, especially the symbol layer from my previous [zmk-config](https://github.com/DustVoice/zmk-config).
On that note, also keep in mind, that the hand-drawn layout in the zmk-config repo probably isn't the most recent.
Especially the right hand symbols are adapted to be used in conjunction with the Num(pad) layer, so that you have things like +, -, / and * available on the right hand.

In the meantime, I refined the layout to be more ergonomic and sensical on the Svalboard.
I might come around to adapt the zmk-config to this new style, but at the moment I use the Svalboard exclusively.

The whole layout is a single [Keybard](https://captdeaf.github.io/keybard/) `keyboard.kbi` file.
I might also include other (semi-)compatible formats, but especially during the current phase of rapid development, I'll keep it simple for you and myself.

PS: You can use Keybard to generate these files yourself for the time being. Simply go to the website, upload my keymap and download your desired format. You don't even have to have a keyboard attached for this.
