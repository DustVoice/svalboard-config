As there don't seem to be a lot of Colemak-DH layouts out there for the [Svalboard](https://svalboard.com), apart from the keybard sample layout, I'll share mine in the meantime.

Just keep in mind that I adapted a big part, especially the symbol layer from my previous [zmk-config](https://github.com/DustVoice/zmk-config).

On that note, also keep in mind, that the hand-drawn layout probably isn't the most recent.
Especially the right hand symbols are adapted to be used in conjunction with the Num(pad) layer, so that you have things like +, -, / and * available on the right hand.

At the moment it's a single [Keybard](https://captdeaf.github.io/keybard/) `.kbi` file.
